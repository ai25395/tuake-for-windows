# tuake-for-windows
a terminal demo for windows like guake or Yakuake
based on powershell, python3.7, pyqt5
you can enter most commands of powershell,because it just send the command to the a subprocess of powershell
And i have provided an exe,you can just download it and have a try without installing any other packages(of course,powershell is needed) 
I make this program because I try Yakuake and find it wonderful.
On windows,we have powershell but i have to start it every time I want ro run something.
Now,with this,all things become simple.
