# tuake-for-windows
A terminal demo for windows like guake or Yakuake
Based on powershell, python3.7, pyqt5
You can enter most commands of powershell,because it just send the command to the a subprocess of powershell
Though i want to upload an exe,but github limits the size to 25Mb.But the exe occupies 34Mb.So you have to build it and have a try.
I make this program because I try Yakuake and find it wonderful.
On windows,we have powershell but i have to start it every time I want ro run something.
Now,with this,all things become simple.
